## Title :- Transforming Adventure Works Retail Operations

### I leveraged Azure SQL Database to extract and analyze data, enhancing data accessibility for Adventure Works. Using Tableau, I created a comprehensive dashboard showcasing shipping and sales statistics, which revealed key insights. Notably, I identified that bicycle specialist products generated $119.96k in revenue and that London was the highest sales location with $206.74k in sales. These insights are crucial for guiding future expansion strategies.
